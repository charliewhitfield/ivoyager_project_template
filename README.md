### What is I, Voyager?
I, Voyager is
1. an open-source software planetarium 
2. a development platform for creating games and educational software in a realistic Solar System.

It is designed to be improved, modified and extended by the community. I, Voyager runs on the open-source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) and primarily uses Godot’s easy-to-learn [GDScript](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#doc-gdscript) (similar to Python). It can be extended into an independent free-standing project (a game or other software product) using GDScript, C# or C++.

### What does I, Voyager cost?
I, Voyager is free to use and distribute under the permissive [Apache License 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License). Projects built with I, Voyager are owned by their creators. You can sell what you make. There are no royalties or fees.

### Where did I, Voyager come from?
Creator and lead programmer Charlie Whitfield stumbled into the Godot Engine in November, 2017, not quite aware of the existence or meaning of the term "game engine." By December there were TestCubes orbiting bigger TestCubes orbiting one really big TestCube*. The name "I, Voyager" popped into Charlie's head in the summer of 2019 while he was pondering the **[Pale Blue Dot](https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/earth/pale-blue-dot.html)**. The name is a play on Voyager 1 (the spacecraft that took that image) and in honor of the Voyager Program. I, Voyager became an open-source project on Carl Sagan's birthday, November 9, 2019.

(* Godot devs, bring back the [TestCube](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/2.1/classes/class_testcube.html)!)
